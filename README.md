The first app was My UniNa. It is the official app for the University of Naples Federico II.
The main problem was that the app did not have a place to check student emails. To read important university emails, students always had to use an external link and go to the webmail website.
My goal was to redesign this app and add the student email feature directly inside it. This makes it much easier for students to handle their studies and emails all in one place.
